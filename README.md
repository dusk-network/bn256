bn256
-----

Package bn256 implements a particular bilinear group at the 128-bit security
level. It is a modification of [Cloudflare's implementation of BN256](https://github.com/cloudflare/bn256) 
which in turn represents a substantial improvement of golang's official version at
https://golang.org/x/crypto/bn256 with significantly faster operations (~10 times faster on
amd64 and arm64).

Bilinear groups are the basis of many of the new cryptographic protocols that
have been proposed over the past decade. They consist of a triplet of groups
(G₁, G₂ and GT) such that there exists a function e(g₁ˣ,g₂ʸ)=gTˣʸ (where gₓ is a
generator of the respective group). That function is called a pairing function.

This package specifically implements the Optimal Ate pairing over a 256-bit
Barreto-Naehrig curve as described in
http://cryptojedi.org/papers/dclxvi-20100714.pdf. Its output is compatible with
the implementation described in that paper.

It also includes functionalities for point compression and decompression into 
a 33 byte representation. The additional byte includes information to resolve 
the ambiguity of calculating the Y coordinate from X coordinate using the curve 
equation

### Note
The original Clouflare's repository includes a `lattice` branch for non-commercial 
use which benchmarks showing a significanlt faster than the `official version`. Such branch has 
been migrated as well.
